# GPU Programming with OpenMP

Welcome to the **GPU Programming with OpenMP** course repository. This course is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of GPU architectures and programming paradigms, with a focus on OpenMP for GPU programming. 

These lectures have been held, and the materials set-up by, Giuliano Taffoni at INAF - Astronomical Observatory, Trieste

## Course Overview

This course will guide you through:
- **Introduction to GPU Architecture**: Understand the key components of modern GPUs, including Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), CUDA cores, memory hierarchies, and execution models.
- **Introduction to CUDA**: Explore the CUDA programming model, the concepts of warps, blocks, and grids, and the fundamentals of writing GPU-accelerated programs.
- **Advanced OpenMP for GPU Programming**: Dive deep into OpenMP directives for offloading computations to GPUs, optimizing performance, and managing data transfers effectively.
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Apply the concepts learned through practical exercises aimed at reinforcing your knowledge and improving your programming skills.
